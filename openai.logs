        ########## OBJECTIVE
        

Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. When
considering the next steps, do not choose operations that will result in a
negative or fractional number. In order to help with the calculations, the
numbers in the parenthesis represent the numbers that are left after the
operations and they are in descending order.
Another thing we do is when there are only two numbers left in the parenthesis, we
check whether we can arrive at 24 only by using basic arithmetic operations
(+ - * /). Some examples regarding this idea:
(21 2) no
since 21 + 2 = 23, 21 - 2 = 19, 21 * 2 = 42, 21 / 2 = 10.5, none of which is equal
to 24.
(30 6) 30 - 6 = 24 yes
(8 3) 8 * 3 = 24 yes
(12 8) no
(48 2) 48 / 2 = 24 yes
Most importantly, do not give up, all the numbers that will be given has indeed a

                    To decompose the task and find a solution, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by examining the given numbers: 14, 8, 8, 2.
2. Explore all possible combinations of the numbers using the basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /).
3. Look for combinations that result in 24.
4. If no combination results in 24, go back to step 2 and try different combinations.
5. If a combination results in 24, return the solution.

Let's begin the search process:

1. Explore all possible combinations using the first number (14):
   - 14 + (8 8 2)
   - 14 - (8 8 2)
   - 14 * (8 8 2)
   - 14 / (8 8 2)

2. Explore all possible combinations using the second number (8):
   - (14 8) + (8 2)
   - (14 8) - (8 2)
   - (14 8) * (8 2)
   - (14 8) / (8 2)

3. Explore all possible combinations using the third number (8):
   - (14 8 8) + 2
   - (14 8 8) - 2
   - (14 8 8) * 2
   - (14 8 8) / 2

4. Explore all possible combinations using the fourth number (2):
   - (14 8 8 2) + 0
   - (14 8 8 2) - 0
   - (14 8 8 2) * 0
   - (14 8 8 2) / 0

5. Evaluate potential subsequent steps for each explored combination:
   - For (14 8 8 2) + 0,
       
                    If the solutions is not making fast progress in achieving the goal, give it a lower score.

                    To obtain 24 using the numbers 14, 8, 8, and 2, we can decompose the task into the following subtasks:

1. Explore all possible combinations of the given numbers.
2. Apply basic arithmetic operations to each combination to evaluate if it can result in 24.
3. If a combination results in 24, return it as the solution.
4. If no combination results in 24, continue exploring other combinations.

1. Evaluate the given numbers and determine if any of them can be used directly to obtain 24 without any operations. If so, return the solution.

2. Generate all possible combinations of the given numbers. This can be done by permuting the numbers and grouping them into pairs.

3. For each combination, apply the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to the pair of numbers and evaluate if any of the results equal 24. If so, return the solution.

4. If none of the combinations from step 3 yield a solution, generate all possible combinations of three numbers from the given set.

5. For each combination of three numbers, apply the four basic arithmetic operations to the numbers in all possible orders and evaluate if any of the results equal 24. If so, return the solution.

6. If none of the combinations from step 5 yield a solution, generate all possible combinations of four numbers from the given set.

7. For each combination of four numbers, apply the four basic arithmetic operations to the numbers in all possible orders and evaluate if any of the results equal 24. If so, return the solution.

8. If none of the combinations from step 7 yield a solution, repeat the process with different orders of operations (e.g., changing the order of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

9. If none of the combinations from step 8 yield a solution, return that there is no solution for the given set of numbers.

Another thing we do is when there are only two numbers left in the parenthesis, we
check whether we can arrive at 24 only by using basic arithmetic operations
(+ - * /). Some examples regarding this idea:
(21 2) no
since 21 + 2 = 23, 21 - 2 = 19, 21 * 2 = 42, 21 / 2 = 10.5, none of which is equal
to 24.
(30 6) 30 - 6 = 24 yes
(8 3) 8 * 3 = 24 yes
(12 8) no
(48 2) 48 / 2 = 24 yes
Most importantly, do not give up, all the numbers that will be given has indeed a
solution.

                    Past solutions:


                    To obtain the objective of 5 10 5 2, we can decompose the task into the following subtasks:

1. Perform all possible arithmetic operations on the given numbers to obtain a result of 24.
2. Check if it is possible to obtain 24 using only two numbers through basic arithmetic operations.
3. If the above steps do not result in 24, repeat the process with different combinations of the given numbers.

Let's explore each subtask in detail:

Subtask 1: Perform all possible arithmetic operations on the given numbers to obtain a result of 24.
1.1. Add the first two numbers: 5 + 10 = 15. (15 5 2)
1.2. Subtract the first two numbers: 5 - 10 = -5. (This is not a valid result, as negative numbers are not allowed)
1.3. Multiply the first two numbers: 5 * 10 = 50. (50 5 2)
1.4. Divide the first two numbers: 5 / 10 = 0.5. (This is not a valid result, as fractional numbers are not allowed)
1.5. Add the first and third numbers: 5 + 5 = 10. (10 10 2)
1.6. Subtract the first and third numbers: 5 - 5 = 0. (This is not a valid result, as zero is not equal to 24)
1.7. Multiply the first and third numbers: 5 * 5 = 25. (25 10 2)
1.8. Divide the first and third numbers: 5 / 5 = 1. (This is not a valid result, as one is not equal to 24)
1.9. Add the first and fourth numbers: 5 + 2 = 7. (7 10 5)
1.10
       
                    If the solutions is not making fast progress in achieving the goal, give it a lower score.
